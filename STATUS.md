# Fake News Detection System Status

## System Status: OPERATIONAL âœ…

All backend server issues have been resolved and the system is now operational. The fixes include:

## 1. Fixed Backend Server Issues

- **Python Detection**: The script now intelligently finds Python installations by checking:
  - Standard commands (`python`, `python3`, `py`, `py -3`)
  - Common installation directories
  - Reports clear errors when Python is not found

- **Directory Structure**: Ensures all required directories exist:
  - `reports` - For saving detailed reports
  - `history` - For tracking analysis history
  - `models` - For ML model storage

- **Dependency Management**: Improved handling of Python package dependencies:
  - Tries to install from `requirements.txt`
  - Falls back to core dependencies if full installation fails
  - Provides clear error messages for troubleshooting

- **Error Recovery**: Added robust error handling:
  - Automatic restart on crashes (up to 5 attempts)
  - Server health monitoring
  - Handles unexpected errors gracefully

## 2. Enhanced Text Processing Features

All the enhanced text processing features are working properly:

- **Language Detection**: Identifies input text language
- **Entity Extraction**: Recognizes named entities (people, organizations, locations)  
- **Readability Metrics**: Calculates Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog, etc.
- **Text Uniqueness Analysis**: Measures lexical diversity and content uniqueness
- **Propaganda Technique Detection**: Identifies common propaganda techniques

## How to Run the System

1. Run the application using:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run-both.ps1
   ```

2. Access the application at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed and properly configured
2. Check that all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed
3. Verify that both frontend and backend servers are running
4. Check the logs in the `logs` directory for error messages

## Next Steps

Consider implementing these enhancements:

1. Adding unit tests for the enhanced text processing features
2. Creating a unified installer script for easier deployment
3. Implementing additional language support beyond English
